# ML-Powered Cervical Cancer DEG Profiling

## About Cervical Cancer

Cervical cancer is a **malignant tumor of the cervix**, mainly caused by **persistent infection with high-risk HPV types**.
It ranks as the **4th most common cancer in women worldwide**.

Early detection using **gene expression profiling** and **biomarker discovery** is crucial for improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and survival outcomes.

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to build a **robust and reproducible pipeline** to:

* Process and analyze **cervical cancer microarray gene expression data**.
* Identify **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** between Normal and Cancer samples.
* Apply **machine learning models** for accurate sample classification.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Imported microarray datasets (GSE63514 from GEO).
* Applied **RMA (Robust Multi-array Average) normalization**.
* Performed quality control using boxplots and PCA plots.

### 2. Differential Gene Expression Analysis

* Conducted DEG analysis using **limma**.
* Annotated probes to gene symbols.
* Filtered DEGs based on **logFC** and **adjusted p-value** thresholds.

### 3. Visualization

* **Volcano plots** for significant DEGs.
* **Heatmaps** of top-ranked genes.
* **PCA plots** showing group separation.

### 4. Machine Learning Pipeline

* Models implemented:

  * k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM ‚Äì Radial Kernel)
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree

* Steps performed:

  * Train/test split.
  * Model evaluation using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity.
  * Confusion matrix analysis.
  * Feature importance ranking.
  * Learning curve visualization.
