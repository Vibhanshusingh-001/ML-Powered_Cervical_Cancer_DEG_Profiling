### 1. `library(tidyverse)`

  The **`tidyverse`** is a powerful and popular collection of R packages designed for data science tasks, built around the philosophy of "tidy data."

* **Key Features:**

  * Provides tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
  * Uses a consistent and readable syntax based on **`dplyr`** (for data manipulation) and **`ggplot2`** (for visualization).
  * Makes data workflows easier and more intuitive.

* **Commonly Included Packages:**

  * `ggplot2` → Visualization
  * `dplyr` → Data manipulation
  * `readr` → Reading data files
  * `tidyr` → Data tidying
  * `purrr` → Functional programming tools
  * `tibble` → Modern data frames

###  2. `library(factoextra)`

  The **`factoextra`** package is designed to easily visualize and interpret the results of multivariate data analyses, such as **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**, **clustering**, and **correspondence analysis**.

* **Key Features:**

  * Helps visualize results from exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  * Functions for creating high-quality plots of PCA, clustering results (e.g., k-means, hierarchical), and other multivariate analyses.
  * Easy-to-use functions like `fviz_pca_ind()`, `fviz_cluster()`, and `fviz_dend()`.

###  3. `library(limma)`

  The **`limma`** package stands for **Linear Models for Microarray Data** but is now widely used for analyzing differential expression in both microarray and RNA-seq data.

* **Key Features:**

  * Fits linear models to expression data.
  * Performs differential expression analysis using empirical Bayes moderation to improve statistical power.
  * Useful for identifying genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated between experimental conditions.

###  1. `library(gdata)`

* The **`gdata`** package provides various tools for data manipulation in R, especially for tasks that are not easily done by base R functions.

*  **Main Uses:**

  * Reading Excel files (older `.xls` files).
  * Combining data.
  * Sorting data frames.
  * Manipulating and reshaping data.
  * Working with lists and factors.

*  Example Functions:

  * `read.xls()` → Read data from Excel spreadsheets into R.
  * `combine()` → Combine data objects.
  * `sortDataFrame()` → Sort data frames by columns.

###  2. `library(gplots)`

* The **`gplots`** package provides enhanced plotting capabilities, especially for heatmaps and other specialized plots that base R doesn’t support as easily.

*  **Main Uses:**

  * Heatmaps (`heatmap.2()`).
  * Enhanced scatter plots.
  * Bar plots with additional features.
  * Plotting multiple datasets.

*  Example Functions:

  * `heatmap.2()` → Creates a heatmap with many extra options (color keys, dendrograms, scaling, etc.).
  * `barplot2()` → Bar plots with additional features.
  * `plotmeans()` → Plot means with confidence intervals.
